  by feature 'incremental_solver' automatically

## 0.15.0, 2022-05-15

- Add `solver::StageManager`, which defines stages, cycles, and segments based on Luby series.
  - At the end of each stage, solver runs the following:
    - clause reduction

  - reason refinement based on LBD values
  - heap operation optimization
- dump UNSAT certificate less frequently

- revise LRB var rewarding
  - LRB tick is changed to the length from assignment to unassignment

- reorganize restart stabilization
- revise clause vivifier, removing non-essential tweaks
- add an experimental feature "adjust_restart_parameters"

## 0.10.0, 2021-07-10

### Fix critical bugs
- fix bugs on chronoBT implementation, which have affected Splr from version 0.3.1 to 0.7.0.
   - `AssignStack::q_head` had a wrong index after backtrack if chronoBT was used.
   - Non-chronoBT was broken if the number of the highest literal in conflicting clauses is one.
- fix a bug which has been rarely occurred by eliminator.
   - `AssignIF::propagate` skipped clause-level satisfiability checking,
     if its `blocker` held an eliminated var, which was never falsified.
   - `ClauseDB::strengthen_by_elimination` didn't turn `LEARNT` off
     when a clause became binary.

### Incompatible API changes from 0.7.0
By introducing new data types, Splr-0.10 checks the status after calling destructive
functions more rigidly.

- introduce a new data `RefClause` for clause-level state transition
- `AssignReason` has 4 states
- define assign::property
- append AssignIF::dump_cnf
- define cdb::property
- ClauseDB exports reference iterators on watch_caches instead of mutable references to them
- ClauseDB exports new transform functions that encapsulate internal state transitions
- ClauseDB and Clause export only immutable references to literals in clauses.
- ClauseDB exports a new method set on a new certificate saver.
- append ClauseDB::strengthen_by_vivification
- remove ClauseDB::count
- remove ClauseDB::countf
- rename ClauseDB::detach to ClauseDB::remove_clause
- remove ClauseDB::garbage_collect
- rename ClauseDB::minimize_with_biclauses to minimize_with_bi_clauses
- remove ClauseDB::new_clause_sandbox

- remove EliminateIF::remove_cid_occur
- remove EliminateIF::stop
- screen Eliminator's fields
- define processor::property
- define restart::property
- append SatSolverIF::save_certification
- append SatSolverIF::dump_cnf

### other changes

- define feature 'trace_equivalency' for debugging
- define (but incomplete) feature 'support_user_assumption'
- activate feature 'clause_vivification' by default

- rename feature 'ema_calibration' to 'EMA_calibration'
- remove comment lines from UNSAT certification files, which default name is changed to 'proof.drat'.
- var reward decay rate has a static value
- dump all stats data into answer files
- slim down */mod.rs
- all vars have a non-zero initial activity

## 0.7.0, 2021-03-14

- answer filenames start with "ans_" instead of ".ans_" by default.
- reorganize trait
  - replace {Export, ExportBox} with {PropertyDereference, PropertyReference}
  - remove: ClauseManipulationIF, EliminatorStatIF

    - progress_ACC
    - progress_MLD
    - pure_stabilization
  - rename feature use_luby to Luby_restart
- clause simplifier and clause vivifier are called at the ends of stages
- Learning Rate based var rewarding uses a non-linear weight function.
- Since Luby stabilization has long cycles, cycle-based tasks were organized. "Stage" is defined based on Luby-stabilization level. Updated terminology:
   - _Luby stabilization_ is a scheme that defines duration of stabilization modes based on Luby series.
   - Luby stabilization stage, or _stage_ is a span that shares a Luby value.
   - _cycle_ is a span between two highest values in Luby series.
   - _var boosting_ is to promote specific vars during a stage.
   - _boosted vars_ or _staged vars_ are the vars promoted by var boosting.
   - _rephrase_ is to promote specific literals during a stage.

## 0.6.3, 2021-02-12

- `Solver` and other structs implement `Clone`
- `VarRewardIF` was merged into `ActivityIF`. `ClauseDB` implements it.

## 0.6.0, 2021-01-16

- reorganize with redefined terminology
   - _stabilizing_ to stop restart periodically (extension of static restart blocking)
   - _staging_ to restrict search space by adding extra var activity
   - _rephasing_ to reuse a good assignment set (so it means 'rephasing to good phases').
- delete dependencies on 'libc' and 'structopt'
- make Splr deterministic or *monotonous*, by removing timer based decision makers. Monotonous means that if a solver solves a problem within T timeout, it solves the problem within any timeout longer than T.
- Solver::restart provides both of `restart` and `stabilize`
- fix a bug in chronoBT, that occurred if a conflicting clause has just a single literal at the conflicting level.
