# a SAT Solver for Propositional Logic in Rust

Splr is a pure Rustic SAT solver, based on [Glucose 4.1](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/).
It adopts various research results on SAT solvers:

- CDCL, watch literals, VSIDS and so on from [Minisat](http://minisat.se) and the ancestors
- Glucose-like dynamic blocking/forcing restarts based on [EMAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08905)
- heuristics adaptation
- pre/in-process simplification based on clause subsumption and variable elimination

*Many thanks to SAT researchers.*

## Usage

Splr is a standalone program, taking a CNF file. The result will be saved to a file.

```plain
$ splr tests/sample.cnf
sample.cnf                                         250,1065 |time:     0.31

    Strategy|mode: in the initial search phase to determine a main strategy
SATISFIABLE: sample.cnf. The answer was dumped to .ans_sample.cnf.

$ dmcr tests/sample.cnf
Valid assignment set for tests/sample.cnf found in .ans_sample.cnf.
```

The answer file uses the following format.

- It contains a single line starting with `s` and follewed by `SATISFIABLE` or `UNSATISFIABLE`.
- It ends a line of assignments separated by a space and `0` as EOL, if the problem is satisfiable.
  Otherwise it contains only `0`.
- Lines starting with `c` are comments, used for dumping statistics

## Correctness

While Splr comes with **ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY**, Splr version 0.1.0 (splr-0.1.0) was verified with the following problems:

* The first 100 problems from
  [SATLIB](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html),
  [250 variables uniform random satisfiable 3-SAT](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/RND3SAT/uf250-1065.tar.gz)
  : all the solutions are correct.
* The first 100 problems from
  [SATLIB](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html),
  [250 variables uniform random unsatisfiable 3-SAT](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/RND3SAT/uuf250-1065.tar.gz)
  : all the solutions are correct and verified with [drat-trim](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/).
* [SAT Competition 2017](https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2017/index.php?cat=tracks),
  [Main track](https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2017/benchmarks/Main.zip)
  : with a 2000 sec timeout, splr-0.1.0 solved:
  * 72 satisfiable problems: all the solutions are correct.
  * 51 unsatisfiable problems: [Lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/) or Glucose completely returns the same result. And,
     * 37 certificates generated by splr-0.1.1 were verified with drat-trim.
     * The remaining 14 certificates weren't able to be verified due to [timeout](https://gitlab.com/satisfiability01/splr/issues/74#note_142021555) by drat-trim.
