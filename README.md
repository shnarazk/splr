Splr -- SAT Solver for Propositional Logic in Rust
----

## Features

- Splr is a pure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)ic SAT solver, based on [Glucose 4.1](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/).
- It adopts many ideas in modern SAT solvers like:
  - Glucose-like dynamic blocking/forcing restarts based on [EMAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08905)
  - heuristics adaptation
  - pre/in-process simplification based on clause subsumption and variable elimination

## Install

Just clone me, and `cargo install`.

Two executables will be installed:

- `splr` -- SAT solver
- `dmcr` -- A model checker to verify an assignment set which are generated by `splr`.

## Usage

Splr is a standalone program, taking a CNF file. The result will be saved to a file.

```
$ splr tests/sample.cnf

## Correctness

While Splr comes with **ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY**, Splr version 0.1.0 (splr-0.1.0) was verified with the following problems:

* The first 100 problems from
  [SATLIB](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html),
  [250 variables uniform random satisfiable 3-SAT](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/RND3SAT/uf250-1065.tar.gz)
  : all the solutions are correct.
* The first 100 problems from
  [SATLIB](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html),
  [250 variables uniform random unsatisfiable 3-SAT](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/RND3SAT/uuf250-1065.tar.gz)
  : all the solutions are correct and verified with [drat-trim](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/).
* [SAT Competition 2017](https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2017/index.php?cat=tracks),
  [Main track](https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2017/benchmarks/Main.zip)
  : with a 2000 sec timeout, splr-0.1.0 solved:
  * 72 satisfiable problems: all the solutions are correct.
  * 51 unsatisfiable problems: [Lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/) or Glucose completely returns the same result. And,
     * 37 certificates generated by splr-0.1.1 were verified with drat-trim.
     * The remaining 14 certificates weren't able to be verified due to [timeout](https://gitlab.com/satisfiability01/splr/issues/74#note_142021555) by drat-trim.
